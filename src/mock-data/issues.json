I was attempting to describe a feature that was in the process of being drawn by the user, who then double-clicked to \"complete\" the feature, and triggered the mode transition.\r\n\r\nI also mimicked the use of **BOLD CAPITALISED** statements used in style source. These are arguably overkill, and I'd be happy to change them."

    "body": "Hi guys, I'm not sure if it's an actual issue for you, but just wanted to ask you: what is the point of not emitting events when using API methods? (changes are in this commit: https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-draw/commit/2de14b4b8638d04c05826af8f51495ca00726ae8#diff-e1d62d8c4965edf0e532dfa19da0891f)\r\n\r\nFor example now it's not possible to catch the moment when all features are deleted from draw if I use `deleteAll` method. I think it's a bit confusing, because I expect event is triggered no matter how the feature was actually deleted: by user or calling any of the API method. I just want to know that it was deleted and handle this situation in my code. I think using `{silent: true}` option should be optional and it should be options for the actual API methods, so when I call `draw.deleteAll` for example, I can specify `{silent: true}`. But it shouldn't be by default. What do you think?"

I'm not sure we're currently using the events in a way that expects this everywhere. For example, I wonder if https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-draw/blob/master/src/modes/direct_select.js#L78 is now subtly wrong, because if its handler fires it means the other `mousedown` handlers won't, right? — but they should.\r\n2. Generally I just kind of find this more confusing than the other way, because we are accustomed to `addEventListener` and EventEmitters where you can attach as many handlers as you want, independently. Why rely on order of operations to filter *all* handlers when you could rely on explicit conditionals to filter those handlers you want to filter?\r\n\r\nSo because of the first point, I opened this issue because at some point the code should be reviewed to ensure there isn't weirdness around expecting more handlers to be called than will be. (The second point is just my question.)"

    "body": "Hi!\r\n\r\nWe use this library a lot for our project: https://compstak.com\r\n\r\nAnd recently we released a new version with Google maps replaced by Mapbox GL maps. Everything works like a charm, thanks for your work. But there is one issue and we have a couple users that already complained about it - so it's pretty important for us.\r\n\r\nLittle story: we use maps for search. And users are able to use different map search tools. One of these tools is so called \"polygon search\": user just puts a polygon shape to the map and should be able to resize/drag it to perform search. Like this: \r\n\r\n![like this]\r\n(https://i.gyazo.com/51c9cb64ce0671d41ecd5ecf2075b6fe.png)\r\n\r\nBut the problem is that your library has separate modes for dragging features (simple_select) and for resizing (direct_select). So it's not possible for us to allow users to drag and to resize polygon at the same time. (And it used to work when we had goole maps - so that's why users complain about it).\r\n\r\nHere is my attempt to solve this issue by creating new mode. I called if `mixed` mode (but you can suggest better name). Basically it's just a mix of `simple_select` and `direct_select` modes. \r\n\r\nThe work is still in progress, and I have to write some tests at least. But just let me know what do you think about idea of this mode. And what else I should implement here.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

Seems like a few fairly dissimilar code styles have accumulated over time.\r\n\r\nThough this is of course not a vital fix, I think it will make the library a little easier to read and build on over time."

As a feature becomes stable we move it from hot to cold forcing us to rerender the cold source. As the number of features and size of those features grows this rerender becomes slow. I think breaking the features into a set of cold sources will help with this. My thought is the the id of the feature can be used as part of a hash function to bucket into the same source quickly."
